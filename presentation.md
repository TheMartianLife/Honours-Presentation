# Overview

A new proposed method for **trend analysis and prediction** with **social media** data that was inspired by the theory of **entropy** from thermodynamics.

Quantitative exploratory study involves calculating **entropy over time** in pre-existing **Twitter** datasets, looking for **two predicted behaviours** as key indicators of feasibility.

# Social Media Analysis

![](assets/insights.jpg)

---

[.slidenumbers: false]
[.hide-footer]

# The Motivation

The **growing use** of and concern about social media—matched by a necessity for their (often free) platform providers to **earn money** and for external parties to **leverage the technology**—has spawned great interest in developing methods to **effectively analyse and gain insight** from its content.[^10]

[^10]: He, Shen, Tian, Li, Akula, Yan and Tao (2015)

---

# The Goals

* Understand the network structure of platforms, how people connect (**social network analysis**, **behavioural research**)
* Understand the content being generated and shared among platforms, how people react to and propagate it (**content and sentiment analysis**, **information diffusion theories**)
* Understand where particular interest comes from, the determinants and effects of popular topics (**topic analysis**, **trend analysis**)

---

[.slidenumbers: false]
[.hide-footer]

# The Challenges

* Social media generates content in **enormous quantity**, at great speed[^11]
* Semi-structured or **unstructed** data with **mixed media** necessary to context[^12]
* Metadata is sparse and **not always accurate**[^13]

# The Challenges

* Hardest of NLP challenges; full of jargon, context- and culturally-specific terms[^14]
* Data is harder to get over time due to platforms commoditising data[^15] and increasing privacy controls[^16]

# Entropy over time

* Reveals descriptive statistical measures about a set of data
* But also measures internal diversity and inconsistency
* Takes focus away from upper and lower bounds—or even ranges—in favour of changes in internal distribution that may be more informative
* Is in some cases sufficient to adapt analysis into Markov-model-based prediction


---

# The Gist

* Social Media use has swept across the globe, impacting the way we communicate, conduct business and view society

* Analysing behaviour on Social Media is seen as important to understanding the opportunities and risks it presents

* Where current methods targeting Social Media have been lacking, a small group of studies have shown varying success in applying methods of analysis from other fields

---

# The Gist

* This study will investigate the feasibility of measures analogous of Entropy over time for trend detection, analysis and prediction

# **Aims & Objectives**

![](assets/target.jpg)

^ Aims and objectives are concisely elaborated.

^ Original and highly relevant hypotheses or research questions are clearly articulated (if appropriate).

---

# Broadly

1. Can the analogous application of **Entropy Theory** present useful information about the lifetime of a trend or topic on a Social Media platform?
2. Is there indication that the method could be applied more broadly, or adapted to be **predictive**?

---

# In this study

Experimentation aims to confirm the dual hypotheses as follows:

1. **increasing entropy over time** may suggest impending critical interest preceding a trend developing to significance, and
2. **decreasing rate of entropy increase over time** after a high entropy or engagement level has occurred may suggest new evolution in the topic.

# Potential **commercial** value

If we can predict changes in topic growth over time, this may aid in early **detection of trends**. 

This may allow parties to release information at points of predicted **optimal reach** or **engagement potential**.

---

# Potential **social research** value

Assuming we can predict trend decay over time if no new stimulus is received, we can identify points where new external stimulus probably was received, even where it is not evident in the platform content.

This can help identify new context or **anomalous trends**.

* Reasonable breadth of functionality in API, well-established tools for research[^29] => *easier to get data, perform and recreate studies*

# Twitter Content

* Posts of maximum 140 characters (**tweets**)
* Accompanying media of one video or up to four images
* May include hashtags, stock tickers, tagged users
* Metadata includes time of posting, engagements, location
* Sharing of posts can be done verbatim (**retweets**), or with added commentary (**quote tweets**)

# Phase 1: Exploration

* Establish "ground truth" of trend behaviour over time portrayed in each dataset 
* Decide on appropriate granularity for discretisation of data (or justify use of full range of values)
* Explore descriptive statistics to establish theoretical bounds
* Develop strategies for dealing with missing data and edge cases

---

# ⚠️ Issues

1. Retweeted tweets show no information about whether likes were given to original or retweet
2. Engagement metrics are associated with time of posting, even though they would have occurred later and over time

---

# ⚠️ Issues

It is assumed that the presence of both effects in **both the test and comparison data** will nullify the effect. 

*But* this study can only assert indicative suitability for historical data until verified with a live study.

# Revisiting hypotheses

I theorised that the patterns to emerge would be two-fold:

1. **increasing** entropy over time **preceding a trend** developing to significance, and
2. **decreasing** rate of entropy increase over time after a high entropy or engagement level **preceding changes in behaviour**.

# Where to go next?

1. **Verify and quantify** the appearance of correlation from initial data
2. **Test bounds** of correlation, extensively
3. **Experiment** with different bucketing values, differently weighted engagement metrics
4. **Observe and record** which factors increase or decrease correlation
5. **Repeat** all of the above with another dataset
