# Social Media

---

# Social Media Usage

* Hundreds of platforms, growing by the year<sup>1</sup>
* Some count users in the millions, with the most popular reaching over a billion users<sup>2</sup>
* From 2005-2015 social media usage rose tenfold in the United States alone<sup>3</sup>
* Of the ~4.5 billion internet users worldwide, an estimated 3.5 billion are users of social media<sup>4</sup>
* Includes individuals, groups and businesses of all sizes<sup>5</sup>

---

# Social Media Usage


* Social media usage spans demographics<sup>3</sup>
* Not just one platform; most use two or more<sup>6</sup>
* Critical to maintaining a competitive edge in business<sup>7</sup>
* Has fundamentally changed the way humanity communicates<sup>8</sup>

---

# Social Media Analysis

![](assets/insights.jpg)

---

# The Goals

* Understand the network structure of platforms, how people connect (**social network analysis**, **behavioural research**)
* Understand the content being generated and shared among platforms, how people react to and propagate it (**content and sentiment analysis**, **information diffusion theories**)
* Understand where particular interest comes from, the determinants and effects of popular topics (**topic analysis**, **trend analysis**)

---

# The Challenges

* Social media generates content of **enormous quantity** at speed<sup>10</sup>
* **Semi-structured** data with **mixed media** necessary to context<sup>11</sup>
* Metadata is sparse + **not always accurate**<sup>12</sup>
* Hardest of **NLP**—jargon, context- + culturally-specific terms<sup>13</sup>
* **Data is harder to get** over time due to platforms commoditising data<sup>14</sup> + increasing privacy controls<sup>15</sup>

# Trend Analysis & Prediction

![](assets/stocks.jpg)

---

![55%](assets/trend.png)

---

# Why? 

* Optimise marketing and outreach campaigns
* Understand content consumption
* Observe cultural change over time
* Jump on bandwagons
* Prevent impending harmful content trends

---

# Challenges

* Subjectivity of viewing, sharing content
* False positives in anomaly detection-based methods<sup>16</sup>
* Reliance on other information sources in alternative methods<sup>17</sup>
* Timeliness requirements for analysis and detection<sup>18</sup>
* Topic evolution over time<sup>19</sup>
* Predicting the future? 🤔

---

# Multidisciplinary challenges

* Very human data; erratic behaviours (**behavioural science**)
* Sharing between non-fully-connected graph structure... (**graph theory**)
* ...of nodes with varying levels of transmissiveness (**social contagion**)
* Different content and sentiments get shared in different ways (**information diffusion**)

---

# Analogous Application

## Novel cross-disciplinary applications

* Social media trends as contagion theory from **Virology** in Medicine<sup>23 - 25</sup>
* Social media trends as the **Technology Adoption** curve from Information Diffusion Theory<sup>26</sup>
* Social media behaviours observed as sound (**Data Sonification**) to aid in anomaly detection<sup>27</sup>
* Social media network interactions as **Evolutionary Game Theory** from Evolutionary Biology<sup>28</sup>

# Entropy over time

* Reveals descriptive statistical measures about a set of data
* But also measures internal diversity and inconsistency
* Takes focus away from upper and lower bounds—or even ranges—in favour of changes in internal distribution that may be more informative
* Is in some cases sufficient to adapt analysis into Markov-model-based prediction

---

# The Gist

* **Social Media** use has swept across the globe, impacting the way we communicate, conduct business and view society
* **Data Analysis** targeting Social Media is seen as important to understanding the opportunities and risks it presents
* Where current methods targeting Social Media have been lacking, some began applying **methods from other fields**
* This study will investigate the feasibility of measures analogous of **Entropy** over time for trend detection, analysis and prediction

# **Aims & Objectives**

![](assets/target.jpg)

^ Aims and objectives are concisely elaborated.

^ Original and highly relevant hypotheses or research questions are clearly articulated (if appropriate).

---

# Broadly

1. Can the analogous application of **Entropy Theory** present useful information about the lifetime of a trend or topic on a Social Media platform?
2. Is there indication that the method could be applied more broadly, or adapted to be **predictive**?

---

# In this study

Experimentation aims to confirm the dual hypotheses as follows:

1. **increasing entropy over time** may suggest impending critical interest preceding a trend developing to significance, and
2. **decreasing rate of entropy increase over time** after a high entropy or engagement level has occurred may suggest new evolution in the topic.

# Potential **commercial** value

If we can predict changes in topic growth over time, this may aid in early **detection of trends**. 

This may allow parties to release information at points of predicted **optimal reach** or **engagement potential**.

---

# Potential **social research** value

Assuming we can predict trend decay over time if no new stimulus is received, we can identify points where new external stimulus probably was received, even where it is not evident in the platform content.

This can help identify new context or **anomalous trends**.

# ![50% inline](assets/how.png)
# **Research Design**

![](assets/research.jpg)

^ Presents a clear, comprehensive and appropriate methodology for the research including research philosophy, research strategy and research design.

^ Research design details the approach, the tools and techniques for data collection, collation, analysis, discussion and interpretation (where appropriate) of the research data.

# Two main steps:

## 1. Creating data
## 2. Analysing data

---

![](assets/harvest.jpg)

# Harvesting from Twitter

---

[.text-emphasis: #FFFFFF]

# Why Twitter?

* Rapid generation of content, rapid decline in interest<sup>17</sup> => *easily observable trends*
* Discrete content size easier to analyse<sup>29</sup> => *more easily verifiable datasets*
* Reasonable breadth of functionality in API, well-established tools for research<sup>30</sup> => *easier to get data, perform and recreate studies*

---

[.footer: *Nowadays this has increased, but this is still the case in the datasets I'm looking at]

# Twitter Content

* Posts of maximum 140 characters* (**tweets**)
* Accompanying media of one video or up to four images
* May include hashtags, stock tickers, tagged users
* Metadata includes time of posting, engagements, location
* Sharing of posts can be done verbatim (**retweets**), or with added commentary (**quote tweets**)

---

# Datasets needed for this study

1. Representing a **single** cohesive topic growing over time
2. Representing a higher-level topic with **multiple** sub-topics or evolution over time

# Why Twarc?

* made by researchers (from the _Documenting the Now_ project)
* many researchers have used it for studies before, establishing its robustness as a tool<sup>31 - 38</sup>
* many have made tools for analysis and visualisation that work with it[^**], so integration issues are not so worrisome

## seemingly random yet consistent distribution of missing datapoints
## = 
## suitably random self-selecting population sample 👍

# Analysis Phase 1: Exploration

* Establish "ground truth" of trend behaviour over time portrayed in each dataset 
* Decide on appropriate granularity for discretisation of data (or justify use of full range of values)
* Explore descriptive statistics to establish theoretical bounds
* Develop strategies for dealing with missing data and edge cases

---

# ⚠️ Issues with historical data

1. Retweeted tweets show no information about whether likes were given to original or retweet
2. Engagement metrics are associated with time of posting, even though they would have occurred later and over time

It is assumed that the presence of both effects in **both the test and comparison data** will nullify the effect.

# Revisiting hypotheses

I theorised that the patterns to emerge would be two-fold:

1. **increasing** entropy over time **preceding a trend** developing to significance, and
2. **decreasing** rate of entropy increase over time after a high entropy or engagement level **preceding changes in behaviour**.

# ...maybe that was too easy? 🤔

---

# Where to go next?

1. **Verify and quantify** the appearance of correlation from initial data
2. **Test bounds** of correlation, extensively
3. **Experiment** with different bucketing values, differently weighted engagement metrics
4. **Observe and record** which factors increase or decrease correlation
5. **Repeat** all of the above with another dataset
