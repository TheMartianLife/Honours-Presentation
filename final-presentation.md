# Social Media Usage

* Of the world's ~4.5 billion internet users, **~3.5 billion use social media**<sup>1</sup>
* From 2005-2015 **social media usage rose 10x** in the US alone<sup>2</sup>
* **Hundreds of platforms**, growing by the year<sup>3</sup>, most use two or more<sup>4</sup>
* Many count users in the millions, with some reaching **> 1 billion users**<sup>2</sup>
* Social media usage spans demographics<sup>5</sup>; includes individuals, groups and businesses of all sizes<sup>6</sup>
* Critical to maintaining a competitive edge in business<sup>7</sup>
* Has fundamentally **changed the way humanity communicates**<sup>8</sup>

^ Social media usage has seen some phenomenal growth over the years, with now an approximated more than three-quarters of internet users worldwide being present on social media. 

^ It's had great impact on how we view society, do business and communicate with one another.

# Social Media Analysis

* Understand the network structure of platforms, how people connect (**social network analysis**, **behavioural research**)
* Understand the content being generated and shared among platforms, how people react to and propagate it (**content and sentiment analysis**, **information diffusion theories**)
* Understand where particular interest comes from, the determinants and effects of popular topics (**topic analysis**, **trend analysis**)

---

[.list: alignment(left)]

# Challenges

* Social media generates content of **enormous quantity** at great speed<sup>10</sup>
* **Semi-structured** data that often includes **mixed media** necessary to context<sup>11</sup>
* Metadata is sparse + **not always accurate**<sup>12</sup>
* Hardest of **NLP**‚Äîjargon, context- + culturally-specific terms<sup>13</sup>
* **Data is harder to get** over time due to platforms commoditising data<sup>14</sup> + increasing privacy controls<sup>15</sup>

# [fit] Trend Analysis & "Prediction"

# ![40% inline](assets/trends.png)

![](assets/stocks.jpg)

---

![](assets/umbrella.png)

---

[.list: alignment(left)]

# Why? 

* Optimise marketing and outreach campaigns
* Understand content consumption
* Observe cultural change over time
* Jump on bandwagons
* Prevent impending harmful content trends

---

[.list: alignment(left)]

# Challenges

* Subjectivity of viewing, sharing content
* False positives in anomaly detection-based methods<sup>16</sup>
* Reliance on other information sources in alternative methods<sup>17</sup>
* Timeliness requirements for analysis and detection<sup>18</sup>
* Topic evolution over time<sup>19</sup>
* Predicting the future?

---

![](assets/pipelines.png)

[.list: alignment(left)]

# Multidisciplinary challenges

* Very human data; erratic behaviours (**behavioural science**)
* Sharing between non-fully-connected graph structure... (**graph theory**)
* ...of nodes with varying levels of transmissiveness (**social contagion**)
* Different content and sentiments get shared in different ways (**information diffusion**)

### _"Social media analysis requires some new ways of thinking!"_[^*]

[^*]: see 15, 20-22

---

[.list: alignment(left)]

## Novel cross-disciplinary applications

* Social media trends as contagion theory from **Virology** in Medicine<sup>23 - 25</sup>
* Social media trends as the **Technology Adoption** curve from Information Diffusion Theory<sup>26</sup>
* Social media behaviours observed as sound (**Data Sonification**) to aid in anomaly detection<sup>27</sup>
* Social media network interactions as **Evolutionary Game Theory** from Evolutionary Biology<sup>28</sup>

## Entropy Theory

![](assets/galaxy.jpg)

---

![](assets/maths.png)

---

[.list: alignment(left)]

# Entropy over time

* Reveals descriptive statistical measures about a set of data
* But also measures internal diversity and inconsistency
* Takes focus away from upper and lower bounds‚Äîor even ranges‚Äîin favour of changes in internal distribution that may be more informative
* Is in some cases sufficient to adapt analysis into Markov-model-based prediction

---

## Aims & Objectives

![](assets/target.jpg)

---

[.list: alignment(left)]
[.footer: *In that it could achieve earlier detection than existing early detection methods.]

# Broadly

1. Can the analogous application of **Entropy Theory** present useful information about the lifetime of a trend or topic on a Social Media platform?
2. Is there indication that the method could be applied more broadly, or adapted to be **predictive**?*

---

[.list: alignment(left)]

# In this study

Experimentation aimed to confirm dual hypotheses:

1. **increasing entropy over time** may suggest impending critical interest preceding a trend developing to significance, and
2. **decreasing rate of entropy increase over time** after a high entropy or engagement level has occurred may suggest new evolution in the topic.

# This required

* data from social media platforms,
* covering concise topics,
* for significant periods of time, with
* sufficiently varied trend behaviours and
* consistent measures of engagement.

[.list: alignment(left)]
[.text-emphasis: #FFFFFF]

# Twitter!

* Rapid generation of content, rapid decline in interest<sup>17</sup> => *easily observable trends*
* Discrete content size easier to analyse<sup>29</sup> => *more easily verifiable datasets*
* Breadth of functionality in API, well-established tools for research<sup>30</sup> => *easier to get data, perform and recreate studies*

# Limitations of pre-existing data

* Start tracking once trend is detected ‚áí **first period often significant** ‚áí little opportunity to precede growth
* Stop tracking once plateaued ‚áí **few secondary growth periods** ‚áí little opportunity to precede change
